# Tensorflow-Object-Detection
My Version of Googles Object Detection API. Plug and Play Video Object Detection.
<br />

Getting Started:  
- Optional: change Input Params at the beginning of object_detection.py
- run object_detection.py Script  <br />
- Enjoy
<br />

My Setup:
- Ubuntu 16.04
- Python 2.7
- Tensorflow 1.4
- OpenCV 3.3.1
 <br />

Current Performance on SSD Mobilenet:
- Dell Laptop with i7 and GeForce GTX 1050: 22fps
